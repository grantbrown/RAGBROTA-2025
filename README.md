# RAGBROTA-2025
### Ad-hoc collection of repeater and simplex frequencies settings for RAGRBAI 2025

[Direct CSV Link](https://github.com/grantbrown/RAGBROTA-2025/raw/refs/heads/main/RAGBROTA.csv)

This is a brief collection of 2m repeater configurations, along with a couple of 2m simplex frequencies which may be of interest to attendees of RAGBRAI 2025. The CSV is intended for use with software like [chirp](https://chirpmyradio.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) to pre-program a HT. 

Repeaters are named according to the following format, where "a" indicates the index of the repeater (in approximate order of relevance over the week), "b" indicates the day(s) a repeater may be accessible, and "RAG" indicates... RAGBRAI:

``` <a>D<b>RAG```

For example, 5D35RAG is the fifth entry, and is expected to be (potentially) relevant on (portions of) days 4-5, between Forest City and Cedar Falls. 

The simplex frequencies currently included are:

* 146.52 - The National Simplex Frequency (not usually very busy in IA)
* 146.58 - The (proposed) National Adventure Frequency
* 146.57 - The first of two suggested 2m frequencies for the Summer Thunder FM simplex event from [HamActive](https://hamactive.com/index.php), which is going on at the time of RAGBRAI
* 146.525 - The second HamActive summer thunder 2m frequency

Corrections, additions, suggestions welcome. 

Notes:
1. I focused on 2m because that's the antenna I have. If you want others feel free to make a pull request.
2. I have not actually used any of these repeaters, but they all appear to be listed as open to the public and I did my best to copy and paste the relevant data from [repeaterbook](https://www.repeaterbook.com/) and county club pages.
3. This is all public data, do what you want with it. I offer no guarantees of accuracy, and I accept no liability for your use of radios and the RF spectrum during or after RAGBRAI. It goes without saying that these frequencies require at least a technician-class ham license to use.
